# MGL-Liver
Liver disease is a significant global burden on health, with about 844 million people suffering from chronic liver disease (CLD), with 2 million deaths each year. Liver diseases are tough to identify and usually ignored in the early stages as it does not show any symptoms. The liver disease diagnosis in the early stage will help to take precautions to prevent future illness. This work focuses on implementing a machine learning (ML) based real-time liver diseases classification framework onto the cloud. The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) was applied to classify liver diseases. The dataset has eleven attributes or features employed to train the models. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented and then the flatten layer output was given to the Logistic regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and achieved a precision of 100% for all models. The ExtraTreesClassifier (ETC) and Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) techniques were applied to select the features extracted by CNN and achieved remarkable 100% precision. The stratified K-fold method was used to evaluate the model performance. The comparative results confirm that the CNN-RF outperforms the literature-reported models. After the evaluation, the model was deployed successfully to the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud.
